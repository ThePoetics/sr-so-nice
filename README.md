# SR so Nice
A Shadowrun-based dice scheme for use with [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com) and the [Dice so Nice module](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/dice-so-nice/).

Shadowrun only concerns itself with a roll of 5, 6, and 1 so this preset blanks out any roll of a 2, 3, or 4 on a D6 and adds new icons for hits and potential glitches. And there's a nice, shiny gunmetal face color to boot.
